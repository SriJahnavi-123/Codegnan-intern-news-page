    <h1>About Us</h1>
    <p>There are a lot of difficult and complicated problems in journalism these days, including how to sustain it.
         But there is one easy problem that every news organization could solve with a moderate amount of effort.

        Yet, this problem goes untended due to ignorance or arrogance.
        
        All news sites need an About page. Most news sites do not have a place online where they tell the public who they are, what they do and what they promise.
         For most newsrooms this is an oversight that has been neglected for too long.
        
        As a profession, we agonize over the lack of perceived value for what we do. I cannot tell you the number of times I’ve heard a journalist suggest that journalism needs a PR campaign. 
        Journalists feel like they devote an enormous amount of energy explaining to the public why their work is important. And certainly if you listen to public radio or saw The Washington
         Post Super Bowl ad or notice a local campaign to garner newspaper subscriptions, there’s a lot of talk about why journalism matters.</p>
